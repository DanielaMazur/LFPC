# Convert regular grammar to Finite Automaton (FA)

The main purpose of LAB_1 is to check if a given string is compatible with the grammar that program reads from v21.txt file.

The program follows several logical steps listed bellow:

1. **_Parse Grammar_** from v21.txt file. A grammar is an ordered quadruple G = (VN, VT , P, S) so, after running the _parseGrammar_ function in the main program we will have **vn vt** and **grammar** variables initialized, where **vn** is the alphabet of variables (or nonterminal symbols), **vt** is the alphabet of terminal symbols and **grammar** also written as **P** is a set of productions.
2. **_Read the input string_** that the user wants to check if it is accepted by FA.
3. **_Check is the input string can be generated by traversing the FA_**, if so write the path that we have to follow to generate the input string.
4. **_Draw the FA graph_**
